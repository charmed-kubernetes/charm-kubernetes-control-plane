# idna>=3.4 and beyond (needed by aiohttp and hvac)
# requires flit-core for building its wheel.
# 
# flit-core can run on python3.6, but requires pip 
# be upgraded to at least 20.0.2 (same as on focal)
#
# psutil 5.9.3 added requirement of setuptools>=43
# setuptools 45.2.0 is the focal default
# 
# layer-basic pins-back pip and setuptools
# for full compatability in bionic, but we can push
# those packages forward if testing shows it operates
